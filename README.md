# AI Final Project
This is a collection of all the exercises done in the semester in the AI subject in a sole Unity Scene.
## Wander
All white agents with brown bags are following a Wander behavior.
## Patrol + Perception
The policeman (blue agent) is performing Patrol behavior. It also has a frustum with which it can detect the robber (Agent in black).
If the patrol agent sees the robber, the agent stops the patrol and follows the robber. When the policeman does not see the robber anymore, they proceed with the patrol.
## Flocking
There is a Bee hive in one of the trees. 50 bees fly around it.
## Formation motion
There are 5 runners (red agents) following a formation motion around the park.
## State Machine
There is a robber (black agent) that follows a random granny (wander agents). When the agent gets close enough,
they rob them and try to hide from the policeman (blue agent), going behind to the farthest obstacle referent to the policeman. Obstacles are the trees and the fountain.
